# Compose files

A collection of my compose files that I use. The bind mounts need to be adjusted to custom locations.
The data for every container is stored in a volume which will be created when the docker-compose file is used.

## Quick start example

1. Move inside desired directory:
```
cd adguard
```

2. Setup container using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Check if docker container is running & if volumes are created:
```
docker ps
```

```
docker volume ls
```
